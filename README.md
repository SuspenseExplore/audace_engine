# About Audace
This project is just me figuring out how to develop VR apps.  The only VR devices I have access to are the Quest 2 and Quest 3S, so I'm mostly following Meta's documentation.  I'm using the OpenXR SDK because I prefer working in a code-based environment rather than asset-based like Unity and Unreal.  I also like to keep options open, so I'm making it cross-platform to include Windows and Android devices. (Currently these options don't support VR.  I only have OpenXR implemented for the Quest devices listed above.)

I admit to not following best practices here since this is primarily an exploratory project.
